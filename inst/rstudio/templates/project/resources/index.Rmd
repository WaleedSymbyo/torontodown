<!-- 
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, you may do so by adding header-includes to the YAML header as follows:

header-includes:
  - \usepackage{pkgname}
  - \usepackage[options]{pkgname2}

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- 
You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the
_bookdown.yml file for PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.
You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd since
they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

Any content included this file (like that shown below) will be included before the first chapter, and after the abstract and acknowledgements. The {-} option here means that there will be no numbers on the Introduction level-1 header (or subsequent sub-headers). You can also use {.unnumbered} so the introduction will be "Chapter 0."

# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ thesis template. This template is based on (and in
many places copied directly from) the [University of Toronto LaTeX
template][0] and wrapped up into Matt Warkentin's [*torontodown* package][1], but
hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX
or LaTeX before.  Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output
included as well. The hope is this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit
of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher,
but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will
reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of LaTeX in combination with _Markdown_ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with _Markdown_ and **R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with
LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to
creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to
read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and
also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.
Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of
your results.  You'll see more on this later.

<!-- 
Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits!
-->

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex
cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

In addition, since Rmd files are plain-text files (unlike Word documents), they can be tracked and version-controlled using `git`. If you are familiar with `git`, it is a piece of software that magically handles most of the tedious tasks related to version control including:

- Tracking your file changes
- Allows you to view differences between file versions
- Allows you to revert back to previous versions

Yes, this means no more having to create a new file each time you edit your thesis in order to avoid overwriting previous work.
